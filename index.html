                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Welcome! I'm Jakub Morawiec, a dedicated and driven Systems Engineering student at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, specializing in the rapidly evolving fields of data engineering and machine learning. My academic journey is enriched by a robust curriculum designed to deepen my technical expertise and practical understanding.</p>
                <p><strong>Education and Coursework</strong></p>
                <p>At the university, I'm immersed in an intensive program that covers a range of foundational and advanced topics. Courses like Algorithm Design, Database Systems, Big Data Methods and Tools, and Artificial Intelligence have equipped me with a solid grasp of theoretical concepts and their real-world applications. These courses have allowed me to develop strong analytical skills and a methodical approach to problem-solving.</p>
                <p><strong>Hands-On Experience</strong></p>
                <p>Through my coursework, I've engaged in several projects that apply these principles, such as simulating data-driven models to improve systems efficiency and implementing machine learning algorithms to solve complex problems. These experiences have not only honed my technical abilities but also reinforced my skills in project management and teamwork.</p>
                <p><strong>Professional Development</strong></p>
                <p>Beyond academics, I am committed to professional growth and continuous learning, evidenced by my proficiency in tools like Microsoft Office and engagement with platforms like GitHub, where I manage projects that showcase my programming and development skills. My ability to communicate fluently in English complements my technical skills, enabling effective collaboration in diverse environments.</p>
                <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
                <p>As I continue my educational and professional journey, I am eager to take on new challenges and leverage my skills in data engineering and machine learning to make a significant impact in the tech industry. I am particularly interested in opportunities that allow me to explore how data can be used to optimize processes and enhance decision-making.</p>
