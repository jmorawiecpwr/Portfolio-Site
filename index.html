				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>Welcome! I'm Jakub Morawiec, a Systems Engineering student at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, specializing in data engineering and machine learning. I am passionate about applying my academic knowledge to real-world problems and continuously advancing my skills. Currently, I am focused on learning machine learning as part of my studies and exploring Advanced Machine Learning (AML) during my internship at W-ITC, a dynamic startup.</p>
				<p><strong>Education and Coursework</strong></p>
				<p>My academic journey covers areas like Algorithm Design, Database Systems, Big Data Methods and Tools, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning tools, Python programming, and Systems Design. This coursework has provided me with strong theoretical knowledge and practical experience in solving complex problems with a methodical, data-driven approach.</p>
				<p><strong>Hands-On Experience</strong></p>
				<p>I've participated in a variety of projects, such as simulating HR management in QSR restaurants with Python and R, researching scientific output using Big Data methods, and developing a Smart Shopping Management System with Java, SQL, and machine learning. Recently, I’ve been working on a project involving counterfeit banknote detection and teaching an AI model to play games using JavaScript.</p>
				<p><strong>Professional Development</strong></p>
				<p>In my previous role, I learned people management in a commercial environment, working under time pressure, handling customer interactions, and managing high-stress situations. This experience also taught me how to handle criticism constructively and how to assertively say no when necessary. Additionally, I am actively involved in KN Solvro, where I manage promotional campaigns, learn backend development with AdonisJS, and contribute to internal projects. I also teach children privately and through the IT4KIDS project at Fundacja Odkrycie, where I help students develop programming skills.</p>
				<p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
				<p>My goal is to leverage my skills in data engineering, machine learning, and software development to drive innovation and optimize processes. I am particularly excited about opportunities that allow me to apply these technologies to make meaningful impacts on business efficiency and societal issues.</p>
